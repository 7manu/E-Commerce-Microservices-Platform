# E-Commerce-Microservices-Platform

An E-commerce microservices platform is a collection of independently deployable services that work together to deliver a full online shopping experience. Each service has its own database and logic, and communicates via REST/gRPC or messaging systems (Kafka/RabbitMQ).

üõ† Core Services

# Product Catalog Service

Stores products, categories, brands.

Supports search, filters, pagination.

Can be scaled with Elasticsearch for full-text search.

# Cart Service

Handles user carts (add/remove items, update quantity).

Stores cart state in Redis (fast access, session-like).

Should support both guest and registered users.

# Order Service

Places and manages orders.

Handles order lifecycle (Created ‚Üí Paid ‚Üí Shipped ‚Üí Delivered).

Works closely with Payment & Inventory services.

# Payment Service

Processes payments (Stripe, PayPal, Razorpay, etc.).

Manages refunds, failed transactions, and retries.

Can later integrate multiple gateways with a strategy pattern.

# Inventory Service

Manages stock levels.

Updates stock when orders are placed.

Prevents overselling (atomic locks or distributed transactions).

# Notification Service

Sends order confirmations, shipping updates, promotions.

Supports Email (SMTP, SendGrid), SMS, Push notifications.


# ‚ö° Scalability Angles

Recommendation Engine (AI/ML)

Collects browsing & purchase history.

Suggests personalized products.

Could be a separate ML microservice (Python + TensorFlow) communicating with core system via REST/Kafka.

Multiple Payment Gateways

Abstract layer for payments (e.g., Strategy Design Pattern).

Plug-and-play different providers (PayPal, Stripe, Razorpay).

Merchant can configure their preferred provider per store.

Multi-Tenant Support

One platform serving multiple stores/brands.

Each store has:

Its own product catalog, users, themes.

Shared backend infrastructure.

Tenant isolation achieved by:

Separate schema per tenant.

Shared schema with tenant_id column.

Database-per-tenant (for high scale).

[ API Gateway ]
        |
   -----------------------
   |         |           |
[Cart]   [Orders]   [Product Catalog]

   [Kafka Streams + NoSQL]


API Gateway ‚Üí Handles authentication, routing, rate limiting. (Spring Cloud Gateway / Zuul)

Service Discovery ‚Üí Eureka / Consul.

Message Broker ‚Üí Kafka/RabbitMQ (for async events like ‚Äúorder placed‚Äù).

Databases ‚Üí Polyglot persistence (different DBs per service).

CI/CD ‚Üí Jenkins + GitHub Actions + Docker + Kubernetes.

üìä Tech Stack

üìà Future Enhancements

Scalability

Auto-scaling microservices in Kubernetes.

Database sharding/replication.
